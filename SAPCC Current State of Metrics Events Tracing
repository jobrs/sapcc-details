SAPCC Tracing/Events/Metrics - Current State

Metrics:
    Everything should have a prom exporter, and/or does. Prom is the way to collect metrics.
    Many things have alert functions, but we use Prom Alert Manager, and disable or don't use any other alert systems.
    Do we use health checks for Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes? How much?
    
Events/Logs: Are Events and Logs the same, or Different?... 
    CADF Format used for Openstack 
    Other Events, Not sure of any consistency around format.
    CNCF working on an open event standard, did not choose CADF:
        https://github.com/cloudevents/spec
        https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md
        CNCF Serverless WG owns the Spec, intended for more than just log events.
    Metadata: 
        Need to attach project id, and perhaps other metadata to logs. 
        Google uses a metadata service
            https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-go/blob/master/compute/metadata/metadata.go
            Caches look ups.
        Openstack has a Metadata service in Nova (and a proxy in Neutron)
            https://docs.openstack.org/dragonflow/latest/specs/metadata_service.html
            Does not currently have ProjectID
            The Actual service does have it, and sends the header to nova 
                X-Instance-ID: The UUID of the virtual instance
                X-Instance-ID-Signature: A cryptographic signature of the Instance-ID[1]
                X-Tenant-ID: The UUID of the tenant
                X-Forwarded-For: The IP of the virtual instance            
    Scaleability:
        Log-based message broker
        Kafka used by AWS, IBM, Most Cloud Providers
        GKE uses a custom pub/sub that is similar to Nats but more reliable 
            https://nats.io/
        SAPCC does not use a message broker at the moment, and instead points directly to Logstash or Elasticsearch
    Archiving: 
        Instead of deleting old logs we should use an S3 connector and place them in Swift. 
        Compress them to save space wherever possible
    Data Warehouse style Analysis
        Currently we use Elasticsearch
        Vora is an option
          
Tracing: 
    No current tracing models I can see.
    CNCF OpenTracing 
        Consistent, expressive, vendor-neutral APIs for distributed tracing and context propagation
        https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md
        
    CNCF Jaeger, a Distributed Tracing System 
        https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger
        Native support for OpenTracing
        All Jaeger backend components expose Prometheus metrics by default (other metrics backends are also supported). 
        Logs are written to standard out using the structured logging library zap.
        Jaeger uses Thrift (https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-idl) not gRPC (and Protocol Buffers) 
        No Multi Tenant support at the moment, but it's being discussed.
